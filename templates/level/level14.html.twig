<h2>Group BY</h2>
<p>
    The GROUP BY statement groups rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country".
    The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT(), MAX(), MIN(), SUM(), AVG()) to group the result-set by one or more columns.

<pre>
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
</pre>

<p>
    As like in the order statements it's possible to group by selected column indices.
</p>
<pre>
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
</pre>
