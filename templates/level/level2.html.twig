<h2>Delete Command</h2>
<p>
    In the database structured query language (SQL), the DELETE statement removes one or more records from a table.
    A subset may be defined for deletion using a condition, otherwise all records are removed.
    Some database management systems (DBMSs), like MySQL, allow deletion of rows from multiple tables with one DELETE statement (this is sometimes called multi-table DELETE).
